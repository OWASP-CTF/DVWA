// This level is protected by the same control as this module's impossible level. Three separate
// ways past the CAPTCHA are closed by adopting it.
//
// The two-step flow was the flaw: step one checked the CAPTCHA, step two changed the password,
// and step two was an ordinary POST that could be sent on its own. Whether step one had happened
// was recorded either nowhere at all or in a hidden `passed_captcha` field the caller supplied
// -- asking the client to vouch for itself. The check and the action now happen in one request,
// so there is no interval in which the result of the CAPTCHA is carried by the attacker.
//
// The high level additionally accepted a fixed string with a matching User-Agent as proof of
// passing. A hardcoded backdoor is not a weaker check, it is no check.
//
// Changing the password also requires the current one, so the form cannot be driven by someone
// who merely reaches the endpoint, and both queries are parameterised.
//
// The anti-CSRF gate impossible.php also carries is left out: checkToken() redirects rather than
// returning, which would bounce a caller away before the CAPTCHA was ever evaluated.
